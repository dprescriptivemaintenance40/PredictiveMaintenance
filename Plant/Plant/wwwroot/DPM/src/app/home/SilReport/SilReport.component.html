        <p style="text-align:left;">
            With the adoption of IEC 61511 and ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 standards,
            Company has made a concerted effort to provide a standardized approach
            to the design and implementation of Safety Instrumented Systems.
            This report describes the methodology used during the
            Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Assessment, Verification of existing Plant, and findings.
            SIL Assessment was accomplished through the use of Hazard Identification;
            Likelihood, Consequence and Risk Analysis.
            Each of the Plant’s Safety Instrumented Function (SIF)
            was identified during SIL Assessment, making use of both layer of
            protection analysis (LOPA) and consequence analysis. A target SIL
            was determined for each SIF through quantitative and qualitative analysis.
            SIL Verification was accomplished using Fault Tree Analysis in order to
            determine the average probability of failure on demand (PFDAVG) of each SIF.
            This analysis was a jointly carried out along with the Company Safety,
            Control & Instrument Maintenance, and Process teams.

        The following aids were used in SIL Assessment and SIL Verification:
        <ol>
            <li>Software tools</li>
            <li>Global work processes</li>
            <li>Global Engineering Standards and Procedures</li>
            <li>Training materials</li>
            <li>SIL application library</li>
            <li>Standard templates for SIL documentation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            DPM APM software have been deployed for Fault Tree Analysis and Layer of Protection Analysis
            have been developed for quantifying risks, performing frequency analysis, and for
            verification of safety instrumented system performance.
            Failure rate data and frequency data for use by these programs was
            obtained through industry generic failure rate data books, 3rd party consultants,
            licensed databases, supplier safety manuals, supplier failure mode effects and
            diagnostic analysis reports, and internal process plant operating experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basic engineering policies (BEP) for use in the design and implementation of safety
            instrumented systems were developed in order to establish and communicate the company’s
            high level policy and strategy for the transition to the new industry standard.
            The BEP provided guidance for more specific and detail oriented engineering procedures
            and standards which were thendeveloped.
        </p>
        <p>
            Training materials were prepared using both internal and external Process Safety,
            Process Control, and Instrumentation subject matter experts.
            These materials covered various aspects of process safety analysis
            and were developed with specific Company terminology and work processes in mind.
            This training was rolled out to the company in a systematic approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            An applications library was developed that contains typical instrumented protection
            systems designs, as well as fundamental information such as FMEA reports, manufacturer
            safety manuals, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completion, SIL assessments were added to the library for future use to support
            management of change or to serve as a starting point for similar applications.
            This library has the benefit of helping to reduce engineering time and to facilitate
            consistent implementations across multiple business units. Standard templates for SIL
            assessment and verification reports were developed. These reports provide a consistent
            format that aids the ease of use and understanding of thematerial.

            This case study describes the work process followed in the SIL Assessment and
            Verification of previously designed safety instrumented systems within the Company.
            The detailed analysis is presented in this report.

        <h6>Data Gathering</h6>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Hazard identification and consequence analysis had been recently performed by Company.
            Existing instrumented protections were previously designed based on the original hazard
            and consequence analysis. This informationwas collected and used in the SIL Assessment
            and Verification.
        </p>
        A summary of process unit for evaluation is listed:
        <ol>
            <!-- <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li> -->
        </ol>
        <p>
            The steps outlined in the Safety Lifecycle (Figure 1) were used as the basis for the evaluation.
            For this case study, the existing Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and risk assessment were
            examined and updated using layer of protection analysis. A SIL target was defined for each
            SIF by back-calculating the required risk reduction needed to be achieved for that SIF in
            order to satisfy the Company’s Corporate risk target. Each existing SIF was then evaluated
            to determine what performance could be achieved given its design, architecture, configuration
            and mechanical integrity program. Calculated performance was then compared to the SIL target
            (using maximum allowable PFDAVG) to confirm that the safety instrumented function was adequate,
            coupled with the other layers of protection to meet our corporate risktarget.

        <h6>SIL Assessment</h6>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The goal of the SIL Assessment was to identify all Safety Instrumented Functions (SIF) and
            to determine a required performance level for each SIF. Company classifiesrisks into
            importance levels (L1 through L3). Only L3S safety instrumented functions were evaluated
            during this case study. It is Company’s interpretation that the L3S classification
            corresponds to a SIF as defined in IEC 61511. Table 1 describes the importance level
            classifications used within Company.

    <div>
        <p>
            At Company, the importance level helps classify the level of security,
            administrative controls and mechanical integrity requirements.
            The importance level also provides guidance and requirements for the level
            of segregation and independence required between the safety instrumented system
            (SIS) and basic process control system (BPCS).
        </p>

            Process hazard analysis information that was prepared was reviewed to identify
            instrumented safeguards. Company typically employs the HAZOP methodology for
            process hazard identification analysis. The nodes of the referred PHA HAZOP
            worksheet that potentially can lead to safety consequences is listed in Table 2.
            The PHA report details the possible hazards, the consequence of the hazard, and
            any safeguards that may exist. Note the safeguards may include equipment and process
            design, mechanical protection systems, instrumented protection systems and administrative
            controls.

            DPM AI Analytics’ developed layer of protection analysis (DPMLoPA) and
            fault tree analysis (DPMTree) software programs were used during the SIL
            Assessment and Verification work process. DPMTree was used to determine
            initiating cause frequencies for the layer of protection analysis when needed
            and the PFDAVG for identified SIF’s. Layer of protection analysis accounts for
            multiple layers of independent protection that are typically part of a processdesign.
