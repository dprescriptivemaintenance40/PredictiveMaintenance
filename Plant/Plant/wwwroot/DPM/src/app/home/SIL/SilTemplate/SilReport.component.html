                    With the adoption of IEC 61511 and ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 standards,
                    Company has made a concerted effort to provide a standardized approach
                    to the design and implementation of Safety Instrumented Systems.
                    This report describes the methodology used during the
                    Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Assessment, Verification of existing Plant, and findings.
                    SIL Assessment was accomplished through the use of Hazard Identification;
                    Likelihood, Consequence and Risk Analysis.
                    Each of the Plant’s Safety Instrumented Function (SIF)
                    was identified during SIL Assessment, making use of both layer of
                    protection analysis (LOPA) and consequence analysis. A target SIL
                    was determined for each SIF through quantitative and qualitative analysis.
                    SIL Verification was accomplished using Fault Tree Analysis in order to
                    determine the average probability of failure on demand (PFDAVG) of each SIF.
                    This analysis was a jointly carried out along with the Company Safety,
                    Control & Instrument Maintenance, and Process teams.

                    DPM APM software have been deployed for Fault Tree Analysis and Layer of Protection Analysis
                    have been developed for quantifying risks, performing frequency analysis, and for
                    verification of safety instrumented system performance.
                    Failure rate data and frequency data for use by these programs was
                    obtained through industry generic failure rate data books, 3rd party consultants,
                    licensed databases, supplier safety manuals, supplier failure mode effects and

                    Basic engineering policies (BEP) for use in the design and implementation of safety
                    instrumented systems were developed in order to establish and communicate the company’s
                    high level policy and strategy for the transition to the new industry standard.
                    The BEP provided guidance for more specific and detail oriented engineering procedures
                    and standards which were thendeveloped.

                <p style="text-align:left; font-size: x-large; font-family: serif;">
                    Training materials were prepared using both internal and external Process Safety,
                    Process Control, and Instrumentation subject matter experts.
                    These materials covered various aspects of process safety analysis
                    and were developed with specific Company terminology and work processes in mind.
                    This training was rolled out to the company in a systematic approach.

                    An applications library was developed that contains typical instrumented protection
                    systems designs, as well as fundamental information such as FMEA reports, manufacturer
                    safety manuals, etc.

                    After completion, SIL assessments were added to the library for future use to support
                    management of change or to serve as a starting point for similar applications.
                    This library has the benefit of helping to reduce engineering time and to facilitate
                    consistent implementations across multiple business units. Standard templates for SIL
                    assessment and verification reports were developed. These reports provide a consistent

                    For this case study, the existing Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and risk assessment were


                    examined and updated using layer of protection analysis. A SIL target was defined for each
                    SIF by back-calculating the required risk reduction needed to be achieved for that SIF in
                    order to satisfy the Company’s Corporate risk target. Each existing SIF was then evaluated
                    to determine what performance could be achieved given its design, architecture, configuration
                    and mechanical integrity program. Calculated performance was then compared to the SIL target
                    (using maximum allowable PFDAVG) to confirm that the safety instrumented function was adequate,
                    coupled with the other layers of protection to meet our corporate risktarget.

                    to identify all Safety
                    Instrumented Functions (SIF) and
                    to determine a required performance level for each SIF. Company classifiesrisks into
                    importance levels (L1 through L3). Only L3S safety instrumented functions were evaluated
                    during this case study. It is Company’s interpretation that the L3S classification
                    corresponds to a SIF as defined in IEC 61511. Table 1 describes the importance level

                of segregation and independence required between the safety instrumented system

                Process hazard analysis information that was prepared was reviewed to identify
                instrumented safeguards. Company typically employs the HAZOP methodology for

                worksheet that potentially can lead to safety consequences is listed in Table 2.

                The LOPA results detail the initiating causes and frequency of each event that
                was evaluated. All layers of protection receiving credit are listed with its
                respective probability of failure. The overall event likelihood that the consequence
                will happen is the sum of the individual intermediate event likelihoods.
                This can be calculated as addition of all initiating causes for repspective category :

            <p style="text-align:left; font-size: x-large; font-family: serif;">
                Company has endorsed implementation of a standardized approach to perform SIL Assessments
                and Verifications when necessary. This risk-based approach included development of training
                materials and software tools customized to Company’s internal work process. An application
                library of commonly used instrumented protection schemes allows for pre-evaluated and consistent
                designs across multiple business areas. This approach allows for a cost effective and timely
                design of safety instrumented protections for business.
